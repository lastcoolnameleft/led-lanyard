# Journey (Part 1)

- Dan Stach (friend) wanted to light Xmas tree using LEDs
- Went down WS2811 + Raspberry Pi rabbit hole
- Many public examples were in C++, so Dan ported them to Python

# Journey (Part 2)

<!--
I learned so much from watching my friend Dan to making my own.  
This session will be about things I learned to help save you from those mistakes, unreturnable Amazon purchases and the sea of confusing lingo, specifications and math.

# Acronyms

- LED (Light Emitting Diode) - turns electricity into light
  - LED Bulb - great for home light plugs, limited on colors
  - LED Strip - powered by wall plugin or USB, 1 pixel wide, sometimes addressable
- IC (integrated circuit) - tiny computer chip
- RGB (Red Green Blue) - additive color mode of 3 primary colors.  Primary for digital displays 
  - RGBW (adds White)
- AC (Alternating Current) - home/plugin power (US)

# LEDs

---

# DIP LED

- Dual In-Line Package
- Resemble traditional light bulb
- Great for starting
- Cost + size prohibitive for "production"

# SMD LED

- Surface Mounted Device
- Described by the dimensions of the LED package
  - e.g. 8520 is 8.5mm x 2.0mm

# COB LED

- Chip On Board
- smaller diodes
- Claim: one continuous, smooth light source (No spots or dots)
- Reality: Not perfect to being dot-free, but pretty close
- New hotness in LED

# Size

* 3528, 5050, 2835, etc.
* Correlate to the size of the chip (in mm)
* Might affect LED strip width (8mm vs 10mm)

# LED chips (most common)

- WS2811 - LED driver IC (NOT the LED)
  - DC 12V, 8 pins (6 used)
  - Use Case: larger spacing, signage
- WS2812 - RGB LED + driver IC (integrated)
  - DC 5V, 6 pins
  - Use Case: compact strips, wearables
- WS2812B
  - DC 5V, 4 Pins, more compact and robust
  - Recommended for new project (reliability + wiring)
  - NeoPixel (Adafruit's brand)
- WS2815
  - DC 12V, more reliable
  - Commercial

---

# Alternate types

- NON-individual addressable
- NEON Lookalikes (strip inside silicon)
- Circuit boards (rings, jewels, individuals, matrix, flexible, strings, sewable)
- DotStar LED - similar to Neopixels, different interface

---

# NeoPixel

- Adafruit's brand of addressable RGB LED
- Based on the WS2812 & WS2811 LED/drivers
- Extensive libraries and support via Adafruit
- Used in wearable tech, custom Lightsabers, interactive displays
- Many form factors (strips, grid, circle)

<!--
_footer: TL;DR: Thank you Lady Ada for making a really easy way to work with tiny LEDs!

# Density

- 30 LED / meter, 60, 144
- More isn't always better
  - can get expensive + use more power

---

# Weatherproof

![bg right:30% w:400](img/ip.png)

- IP = Ingress Protection (rating)
- IP20 - no waterproofing (indoor use only)
- IP30 - no waterproofing (slightly better than IP20)
- IP65 - water resistant (damp locations)
- IP67 - waterproof (good for outdoor, wet locations)
- IP68 - full waterproof (underwater)

# Batteries + Power Consumption

WARNING:  MATH INVOLVED

---


![bg right:40% w:500](img/ohm-volt-amp.png)

- Volts = pressure pushing the water through the pipe
- Amps = flow rate of the water 
  (how much is moving)
 - Ohms = resistance in the pipe 
  (how hard it is for water to flow)

---

# Battery Capacity

- mAh = how long a device can run
- Think of mAh as the size of a fuel tank:
  - A 2000 mAh battery can power a 100 mA device for 20 hours
  - Higher mAh = longer runtime

---

# How do you measure this?!

![bg right:40% w:500](img/usb-multimeter.png)
- [USB multimeters](https://amzn.to/45PBLf5) are your friend!

---

# Example 

- 5 meter WS2812B strip, 60 p/m, 5050 RGB, DC5v
- Full brightness, all LED on white
- Device current draw: 1.8 A
- Battery capacity: 10,000 mAh = 10 Ah
- Battery life = Battery capacity รท Device current
- Battery life = 10 Ah รท 1.8 A = 5.56 hours
