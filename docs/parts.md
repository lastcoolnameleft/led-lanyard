## Parts

If you want, you can purchase the components individually and assemble yourself.  If there's enough interest, I will offer a packaged solution.

* [14 key Wireless RF Remote + LED RGB Controller for WS2812B](https://amzn.to/2WrNkZ1)
  * This is the hardware controller for the LEDs which includes the remote.
  * There are other RF remote + controller combos out there, and the "Add DIY" button because it allows you to cycle through specific patterns.
  * Unfortunately, controlling the brightness isn't intuitive (or documented).  To change brightness, uou must select a solid color and then hold down the "Speed -/+" button to change.
* [WS2812B RGB LED Strip 144 pixels](https://amzn.to/2K5UtaP)
  * This is where the magic happens.
  * 1m, 144 pixels provides the best patterns with highest pixel density.
  * There are 3 types of shielding (covering) when ordering:
    * IP30 (no shielding) allows for maximum flexibility; however, is the most likely to break
    * IP65 is nice but is stiffer and the silicone shielding makes it tricky to feed through the webbing.
    * IP67 will not fit throught the nylon webbing, but is waterproof
* [Portable battery](https://amzn.to/2I4XtBS)
  * This one uses Micro USB.  If you want to use a different battery, then make sure you find a Barrel Jack adapter which fits.
  * There are batteries which hold more power, and this one works well considering weight, storage, size, and form factor.
* [5.5mm x 2.1mm Barrel Jack to Micro-USB Cable](https://amzn.to/2F0102G)
  * Used to connect the Micro USB Power Bank to the LED Controller.
  * If you want to use a different battery, then make sure you find a Barrel Jack adapter which fits. 
* [Tubular Polyester Webbing](https://www.strapworks.com/product_p/stpw1.htm)
  * You'll need at least 4 feet.
  * White diffuses the light better, but black has a better aesthetic, IMO.

## Case

For the case, you can use the two following options:

### Plastic craft case

* [4"x6" Craft Case](https://amzn.to/2ICOuYP)
  * This will hold the electronics and battery.
  * A 3D Printable case is currently being worked on
* [4"x6" Vinyl Envelope](https://amzn.to/2Na9YRd)
  * Since most badges are 4"x6" or less, this should be able to accomodate most badges provided by conferences.
* [4"x6" Index Card](https://amzn.to/2XWJVBS)
  * Optional.  You only need 1.  This is to provider a backer for the badge and hide the electronics.
* [Hand Riveter Set](https://amzn.to/2IDv6uS)
  * Somewhat optional; however, this is the best solution I found for affixing the badge sleeve to the craft case.  Optionally, you could use Super Glue or E6000; however, it does not adhere well.
* Matches
  * Used to remove frays after cutting the webbing

### LEGO
