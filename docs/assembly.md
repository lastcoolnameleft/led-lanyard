**DISCLAIMER:  I am not an electrical engineer.  Please use with caution.**

**WARNING!  Pulling too much current may cause controller to freeze.  This can happen when LEDs are on full brightness or when displaying white (which is all 3 RGB LEDs running at the same time).  Unplug battery and plug back in to reset.**

1. Plug LED strip into LED Controller.  
1. Plug LED Controller into Barrel Jack cable
1. Plug Barrel Jack cable into Portable Battery
1. Press power button on LED Controller
1. Change brightness to ~50% to prevent from pulling too much current.
  1. If the controller pulls too much current, then it can freeze the controller.  This can be reset by unplugging and replugging the battery.

1. Drill through bottom half of vinyl envelope on top of the same drilled holes.
1. Using the rivet set, drive rivets through vinyl envelope and craft case into the 2 drilled holes.

# Assemble Lanyard

1. Cut webbing to 42".
1. Cut any loose frays and burn frays with fire with matches.
1. Add dab of hot glue about 2" high, 1.5" inches from each end of webbing.  (Doesn't need to be pretty)
1. (Optional) Cut extra wires off of LED strip so that only connection to controller still exists.
1. Feed LED strip into webbing
1. Reconnect LED strip to LED Controller, Barrel Jack cable and Portable Battery.  Turn on controller to verify connectivity.
1. Open badge holder and feed webbing so that top of badge rests on hot glue glob.  Close badge holder.
