# LED Lanyard

This project is for the design and reference for building of an LED lanyard, primarily used in conferences.

## Background

My LED Lanyard implmentation was inspired by my buddy [Dan Stach](https://github.com/DanStach/)'s original work using [Neopixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168).  Extending this design,  I worked with [Bricks and Minifigs of Dallas, TX](https://www.facebook.com/BAMNorthDallas/), to build a LEGO case and [got a lot of interest from social media](https://twitter.com/lastcoolname/status/1136092293801418753).

## Getting started

This repo is broken up into:

* [Parts](parts.md) - If you are interested in building your own, this is the Bill Of Materials (BOM).
* [Assembly](assembly.md) - After you have all of the parts, you will need to assemble them.
* [Extending with Raspberry Pi](raspberrypi.md) - The RF controller has pre-programmed effects; however, if you want to program your own, you can use your own controller.  I have created some examples with integrations to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and [Azure Bot Framework](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).
* [Presentation](presentation.pdf) - PDF of the presentation
